            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Lal Bahadur Shastri was an Indian politician and statesman who served as the Prime Minister of India from 1964 to 1966. 
                He previously served as home minister from 1961 to 1963.

            Shastri was born to Sharad Prasad Srivastava and Ramdulari Devi in Mughalsarai (present-day Uttar Pradesh) on 2 October 1904. He studied in East Central Railway Inter college and Harish Chandra High School, which he left to join the non-cooperation movement. 
            He worked for the betterment of the Harijans at Muzaffarpur and dropped his caste-derived surname of "Srivastava". Shastri's thoughts were influenced by reading about Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and Annie Besant. Deeply impressed and influenced by Gandhi, he joined the Indian Independence movement in the 1920s.
            He served as the president of Servants of the People Society (Lok Sevak Mandal), founded by Lala Lajpat Rai and held prominent positions in the Indian National Congress (INC). Following independence in 1947, he joined the Indian government and became one of prime minister Nehru's key cabinet colleagues, first as railways minister (1951–56), and then in numerous other prominent positions, including the home ministry.
            
            As prime minister, Shastri promoted the White Revolution – a national campaign to increase the production and supply of milk – by supporting the Amul milk co-operative of Anand, Gujarat and creating the National Dairy Development Board.
             Underlining the need to boost India's food production, Shastri also promoted the Green Revolution in India in 1965. This led to an increase in food grain production, especially in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. He led the country during the Second India–Pakistan War. 
             His slogan "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan" ("Hail to the soldier; Hail to the farmer") became very popular during the war. The war formally ended with the Tashkent Declaration on 10 January 1966; Shastri died the next day.

            <p>
                In 1928, Shastri became an active member of the Indian National Congress at the call of Mahatma Gandhi.
                Later, he worked as the Organizing Secretary of the Parliamentary Board of U.P. in 1937. In 1940, he was sent to prison for one year, for offering individual Satyagraha support to the independence movement.
                On 8 August 1942, Mahatma Gandhi issued the Quit India speech at Gowalia Tank in Bombay, demanding that the British leave India. Shastri, who had just then come out after a year in prison, travelled to Allahabad.
                For a week, he sent instructions to the independence activists from Jawaharlal Nehru's home, Anand Bhavan. He served as an elected representative for United Provinces in 1937 and 1946.
            
                Lal Bahadur Shastri died on the night of January 10/11, 1966, in the city of Tashkent, hours after signing a peace agreement.

                The cause of death was reported as cardiac arrest, but it remains a mystery, as there are many conspiracy theories about his death.
                He received the highest civilian award, Bharat Ratna, posthumously in 1966.... <br>
                REMEMBERING HIS LEGACY <br>
                As we pay tribute to Lal Bahadur Shastri, we're reminded of the lasting impact he's had on our nation.numerous colleges, schools, and memorials across India bear his name, a testament to his enduring legacy. 
                Our institution, Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of technology for women, is proud to be among them, inspiring generations of students to embody the values of honesty, hard work, and selflessness that Shastri ji exemplified.
   
               As we remember his remarkable contributions to India's freedom struggle and his visionary leadership, we're inspired to strive for a brighter future, guided by the principles of justice, equality, and compassion that he upheld.
   
               Let's continue to draw inspiration from Shastri ji's life and work, and may his memory continue to motivate us to build a better world for all. <br>
               Concluding with his great words  "I am not ready to be enslaved by any power, and that is the message I want to convey."
